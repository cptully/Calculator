# Calculator

This project is a simplistic calculator with no icon as of this writing. It was created 
as an exercise in unerstanding Stack Views in iOS programming and xCode.

I chose to add actual calculation capabilities to push my understanding of Swift's math 
capabilities and string processing capabilities.

I will continue to update itg as I have time and curiosity to explore more imn these two areas.
